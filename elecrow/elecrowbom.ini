; Install this in a configuration file directory of your choice
;
; These fields need to be added to the symbols in the schematic:
;
; Manufacturer, e.g. Onsemi
; Package, e.g. SOT-223
;
; The Description field will be entitled Your Instructions / Notes
; The Part and Footprint fields are appended as extra columns
;
; From eeschema's BoM generation command, create a generator recipe to run:
;   python3 KiBoM_CLI.py --cfg elecrowbom.ini %I %O
; Use absolute paths for python3, KiBoM_CLI.py and elecrowbom.ini
;

[BOM_OPTIONS]
; General BoM options here
; If 'ignore_dnf' option is set to 1, rows that are not to be fitted on the PCB will not be written to the BoM file
ignore_dnf = 1
; If 'html_generate_dnf' option is set to 1, also generate a list of components not fitted on the PCB (HTML only)
html_generate_dnf = 1
; If 'use_alt' option is set to 1, grouped references will be printed in the alternate compressed style eg: R1-R7,R18
use_alt = 0
; If 'number_rows' option is set to 1, each row in the BoM will be prepended with an incrementing row number
number_rows = 1
; If 'group_connectors' option is set to 1, connectors with the same footprints will be grouped together, independent of the name of the connector
group_connectors = 1
; If 'test_regex' option is set to 1, each component group will be tested against a number of regular-expressions (specified, per column, below). If any matches are found, the row is ignored in the output file
test_regex = 1
; If 'merge_blank_fields' option is set to 1, component groups with blank fields will be merged into the most compatible group, where possible
merge_blank_fields = 1
; Specify output file name format, %O is the defined output name, %v is the version, %V is the variant name which will be ammended according to 'variant_file_name_format'.
output_file_name = %O_bom%V
; Specify the variant file name format, this is a unique field as the variant is not always used/specified. When it is unused you will want to strip all of this.
variant_file_name_format = _(%V)
; Field name used to determine if a particular part is to be fitted
fit_field = Config
; Complex variant processing (disabled by default)
complex_variant = 0
; Character used to separate reference designators in output
ref_separator = ','
; Make a backup of the bom before generating the new one, using the following template
make_backup = %O.bak
; Default number of boards to produce if none given on CLI with -n
number_boards = 1
; Default PCB variant if none given on CLI with -r
board_variant = ['default']
; Whether to hide headers from output file
hide_headers = 0
; Whether to hide PCB info from output file
hide_pcb_info = 1
; Interpret as a Digikey P/N and link the following field
digikey_link = 0

[IGNORE_COLUMNS]
; Any column heading that appears here will be excluded from the Generated BoM
; Titles are case-insensitive

[GROUP_FIELDS]
; List of fields used for sorting individual components into groups
; Components which match (comparing *all* fields) will be grouped together
; Field names are case-insensitive
Part
Part Lib
Value
Footprint

[COMPONENT_ALIASES]
; A series of values which are considered to be equivalent for the part name
; Each line represents a list of equivalent component name values separated by a tab
; e.g. 'c\tc_small cap' will ensure the equivalent capacitor symbols can be grouped together
; Aliases are case-insensitive
c	c_small	cap	capacitor
r	r_small	res	resistor
sw	switch
l	l_small	inductor
zener	zenersmall
d	diode	d_small

[JOIN]
; A list of rules to join the content of fields
; Each line is a rule, the first name is the field that will receive the data
; from the other fields
; Use tab (ASCII 9) as separator
; Field names are case sensitive

[REGEX_INCLUDE]
; A series of regular expressions used to include parts in the BoM
; If there are any regex defined here, only components that match against ANY of them will be included in the BOM
; Column names are case-insensitive
; Format is: "[ColumName]\t[Regex]" (separated by a tab)
References	^[^#]

[COLUMN_RENAME]
; A list of columns to be renamed
; Format is: "[ColumName]\t[NewName]" (separated by a tab)
Component	#
References	Reference
Quantity Per PCB	QTY
MPN	Manufacturer Part number

[REGEX_EXCLUDE]
; A series of regular expressions used to exclude parts from the BoM
; If a component matches ANY of these, it will be excluded from the BoM
; Column names are case-insensitive
; Format is: "[ColumName]\t[Regex]" (separated by a tab)
